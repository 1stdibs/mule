<p class="example-title">Running the example</p>
<p class="example-text">
The Notifications example is a web application on its own, so in order to launch it and use it you can perfom the following steps:
<ol class="example-text">
<li>Point your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8082/services/notifications/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8082/services/notifications/</a></li>
<li>You will immediately start receiving notifications (new ones are displayed on top). So far, you will only receive the heartbeat notification every 10 seconds</li>
<li>Type something (e.g.: "Hello Mule!") in the "Secure Echo" text box, leave the drop down box value as "Administrator" and hit the "Send" button. You will see two events associated with the "TestEcho" resource id (one pre-invocation and one post-invocation).</li>
<li>Type something else (e.g.: "Klaatu barada nikto") in the "Secure Echo" text box, select "Anonymous" from the drop down box and hit the "Send" button. This time validation will fail and you will receive the associated warning event (no pre/post notification, since no components were called)</li>
</ol>
