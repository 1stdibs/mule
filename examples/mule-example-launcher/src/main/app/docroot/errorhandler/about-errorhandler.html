The error handler example demonstrates using Spring beans as Mule service component implementations and how to publish messages to multiple outbound endpoints.

<p class="example-title">Under the Hood</p>
<p class="example-text">
The sample consists of two services: ExceptionManager and BusinessErrorManager. The BusinessErrorManager is a simple service used to log a message to the console when a message is received. In this example, it is used to receive BusinessException message over JMS to simulate a real-world exception processing application.

The ExceptionManager is a service that receives exception messages and performs some action depending on the type of exception. For example, if a fatal exception is received, an email is sent to the system administrator. If a standard system exception is received, it is logged to a file on the local file system. The purpose of this example isn't to implement an exception handler, but to demonstrate the following features:

<ul class="example-text">
	<li>All the service components in the error handler are configured as Spring beans in the same Mule configuration file</li>
    <li>The error manager has multiple outbound endpoints configured on it, and the example demonstrates how to dispatch to different endpoints</li>
    <li>The messages in the system are Java objects and need to be converted to and from XML. The example demonstrates chaining multiple transformers together</li>
 </ul>
