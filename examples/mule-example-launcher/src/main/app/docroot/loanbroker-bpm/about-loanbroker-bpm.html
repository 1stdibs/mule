The BPM example illustrates using a business process engine (JBoss jBPM) to orchestrate the loan broker application. Observe how the process flow and decision logic are cleanly defined in a process definition file (which could be created and maintained using a GUI process editor), while the systems integration and messaging is handled by Mule.
