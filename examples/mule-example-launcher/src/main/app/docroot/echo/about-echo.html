<p class="example-title">Description</p>
<p class="example-text">
This example shows how to add message processing components, in this example Logger and Echo, to a Flow. By doing so, you can perform custom logging in your Mule application. Logging is useful to introspect the current message and create logging events for your specific needs.
</p>

<p class="example-title">Under the Hood</p>
<p class="example-text">
The Mule flow created a HTTP server for accepting incoming requests. The flow is invoked by going to the URL in your browser http://localhost:8082/echo. When a request is received, the echo component simply returns whatever was sent as part of the request.
Additionally a Logger message processor demonstrates how different processors can be sequenced in a Flow. And the #[payload] expression is used to log the payload of the request. The expression is evaluated for every message received at runtime.
