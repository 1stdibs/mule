<p class="example-title">Description</p>
<p class="example-text">
Provides:
    <ul class="example-text">
    <li>A bookstore catalog service with a public interface for browsing the catalog and an admin interface for adding books to the catalog</li>
    <li>An order service that allows customers to order books</li>
    <li>An email notification service that sends an email when an order has been placed</li>
    <li>A data warehouse service that tracks statistics on the books, such as the number of books sold, total revenue, and best sellers</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<p class="example-title">Under the Hood</p>
<p class="example-text">
The example bundles two web apps:
    <ul class="example-text">
    <li>The Admin webapp includes the Mule configuration file and the service definitions. This module is hosted behind the firewall</li>
    <li>The Bookstore webapp includes the JSPs for displaying the catalog to customers outside of the firewall</li>
    </ul>
For simplicity, both web apps are bundled together in a singe Mule application. In a real world scenario the web apps would be deployed separately using the following architecture:
