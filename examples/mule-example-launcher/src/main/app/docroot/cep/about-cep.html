<p class="example-text">
The application is an alert mechanism for sudden changes in a stock ticker. It is implemented using the CEP functionality of Drools. A group of companies to monitor is defined, then the current stock price of each company is kept as a fact in Drools' working memory. A periodic stock ticker is used as an event stream and Drools' ruleset is defined such that a percentage delta greater than a pre-defined threshold triggers an alert to be sent as a Mule message. Both the event stream and the alerts are routed via AJAX to a web page so that the user can monitor the processing.
