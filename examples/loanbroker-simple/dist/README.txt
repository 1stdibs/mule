| Loan Broker Simple Example |
+----------------------------+
Copy the pre-built application archive (mule-example-loanbroker-simple.zip) to the application
folder ($MULE_HOME/apps) and start Mule. When Mule is running go to your browser
to run it:

    http://localhost:8888/?name=Ross

You can change 'Ross' to any string you want.

For more information, refer to http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/MULE3INTRO/Examples

+----------------------+
| Building the example |
+----------------------+
First, make sure you have set the MULE_HOME environment variable as recommended 
in Mule's README.txt

Depending on the build tool you are using (Ant or Maven), you can build the 
example by simply running "ant" or "mvn".  This will compile the example 
classes, produce an application zip file and copy it to 
$MULE_HOME/apps.
